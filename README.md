# MongoDB-StORM

MongoDB-StORM is the MongoDB module for StORM - a Swift ORM.

It aims to be easy to use, but flexible. Drawing on previous experiences, whether they be good, bad or ugly, of other ORM's, I have tried to build a system that allows you write great code without worrying about the details of how to interact with the database.

StORM is built on top of [Perfect](https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/Perfect) - the most mature of the Server Side Swift platforms.

### What does it do?

* Abstracts the database layer from your code.
* Provides a way of adding save, delete, find to your Swift classes
* Gives you access to more powerful find, create, update and delete.
* Maps result sets to your classes
